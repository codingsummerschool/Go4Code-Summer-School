# This project will look at natural language proccesing, google, machine learning (tensor flow) and some hardware. 

Read some articles about AI, machine learning and google: 

* [It's only a matter of time before criminals turn AIs against us](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ai-security-malicious-threats-open-ai-cambridge-cser)
* [CARS: Google is turning Jaguar's electric I-Pace into a self-driving taxi](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/jaguar-ipace-waymo-autonomous-google-self-driving)
* [Take back control of all the data Google stores about you](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-history-search-tracking-data-how-to-delete) 

**Following on from these articles, AI is becoming part of our lives and many of the consquences are not yet known. It is important therefore we learn some of how it works! This project will hopefully start you off on how to impletment some of it, but you may need to read more into how it is actaully working** 

**Learning a bit about AI and google is a valueable skill and perhaps important knowlegde whether or not you choose to explore AI futher**

**Follow the guide you have inside the box and online: [AI PY Google](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#project-overview)** Get started and see how far you get! 

Things to think about:
**What is tensor flow?** 
**Where is tensor flow used?** 


**After you have completed the set up and have it all working, what could you create with it?** : Perhaps a revision tool, making flashcards wherenby you ask the vioce kit your exam question and it replies with your answer, or the other way round and it can tell you if you are right or wrong?
