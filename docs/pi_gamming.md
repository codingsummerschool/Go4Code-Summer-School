**This is your project idea that you wrote! : *we are going to make a small, arcade like platformer with an endless mode and story mode. The game will be played on a raspberry pi, connected to a small lcd monitor and be controlled by a retro style NES controller. We will 3d print a case that holds the pi and monitor, to give it a more genuine look.*

**Here is the monitor you have: [Pi Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B013JECYF2/ref=psdc_949408031_t1_B00XVDULES%20(monitor[I%20have%20amazon%20prime,%20so%20i%20could%20use%20my%20account]),%20https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/nes-style-retro-usb-gamepad-raspberry-pi-windows-mac-compatible?variant=1268703068174)


**Read the guide it came with and try to get it working? 



**Here are some perhaps useful guides, to have a look at other stuff to do after creating your game or maybe some game ideas: 

(You don't have to follow them completly or let us know which resources you are using). 

One of the main operating systems dedicated for gaming on the Raspberry Pi is called the RetroPie which has support to emulate a wide variety of older consoles.

Because of the specialised nature of RetroPie, the entire process is very streamlined and simplified. For maximum enjoyment, it is recommended that you use a games controller, either one specifically for the raspberry pi or an xbox/playstation controller which RetroPie natively support.
