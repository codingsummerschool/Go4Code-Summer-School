# Algorithims

## General

> So far you have been working on some of the raspberry pi challenges (e.g creating snake, magic eight ball, the countdown clock ect). 
You have also been thinking about what you want to create.

> If your group hasn’t thought of an idea yet, we will provide projects and order some equipment for next week for you to start to build and programme.

> At the UCL summer school you will create a longer project of your choice (again if not, we will think of a real world problem for you to solve). As mentioned the summer school will take place over 3 days, and is an excellent opportunity for you to develop your general learning and programming skills, as well as expose you to the university environment and its students. 

## Idea of Algorithms

Today we will focus on the valuable skill of ‘problem-solving’. You will be designing and implementing your own algorithms.  

Algorithm : 
```
“a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations”
```
```
“An algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem”
```

You will have to think through your algorithm, and testing it as you go along. 

## Your challenge: Creating hangman
Sounding simple, but will require you to use fundamental programming concepts and see if you can solve it without looking at the solutions too much.  

> If you can do this you should be able to move onto the harder problems (near the bottom of the page) . 

1.	Write down your algorithm (in non-code form), of hangman works / what steps happen in a game of hangman? to help you think about how you are going to do it.

For example 

<img src = "./Media/hangman_al.png"></img>

2.	Write down your Algorithm (in non code form) of how you therefore might code the game of hangman ? 
For Example

(click here to see one that I wrote after you have written yours, compare it to yours it doesn’t have to be the same as long as you think yours will work. ) . 

Now you know the instructions you will need for to create hangman; you have designed your algortihim: 

### Open up trinket.io  https://trinket.io/  (if you haven’t already, create an account) navigate to where you see: 

### Follow this guide, which contains code examples and the functions which will be useful:

> <a href="https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/10/32-hangman.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a>


There are many variations to how you could do this, you don’t have to follow the guide completely. 

Things your code will most likely include: 

-	If and else statements 
-	Looping through arrays (for loops)
-	While loops 
-	Print statements 
-	User inputs 

(The solution written here is not completely similar to this) 

When you are writing your code remember to:
- the errors that occur, google them
- when something isn’t working, use print statements! 
- for certain functions, look them up in python documentation (here) 

**If you finish this, and want to further test your algorithmic thinking work your way through this problem sheet: 
(Printed off sheet, which you should use to help solve the problems)**

If you get really stuck, here are the solutions to the above problem sheet: 

> **Or if you have your raspberry pi, how might you go about having the drawing of the hangman displayed?** 

### What is the importance of learning to be able to create Algorithms?
-	Breaking down the problem 
-	Essentially thinking the steps through
-	You solved it! Problem-solving is a skill, it isn’t about learning syntax, there isn’t only one correct solution, you have to think of the solutions (evening if you are copying and pasting you still should think about what’s going on) and learning how you go about implementing this and ‘debugging’; figuring out where your solution is going wrong.
