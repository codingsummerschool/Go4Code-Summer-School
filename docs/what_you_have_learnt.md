# Summary
Congratulations on completing the UCL summer coding school.

Over the last few days you have learned to:

* Define and use variables
* Use functions
* Create lists
* Use conditional statements
* Use *for* and *while* loops
* RGB colours
* Combine all of the above to make really cool projects!

The next steps you could take are:

* Write your own functions
* Learn how to use dictionaries
* Learn how to use libraries
* Classes
* Exception handling
* And much more!

## Useful websites

## Equipment

The Raspberry Pi is your own computer, all you need to complete the package is:
* HDMI cable
* USB Mouse and Keyboard
* An HDMI TV/Monitor

It has Wifi and a Linux based operating system installed (google if you want to find out more).

Examples of more projects you can do with your Pi's:
* Motion sensitive security camera
* Retro game console
* Smart lights
* Music Player

## Take home messages

* It's okay to google - day to day programmers do this all the time!
* Mistakes in code are common - its okay to get things wrong
* Don't be afraid to use trial and error
