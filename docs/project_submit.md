# Project Selection

So far you have been working on short raspberry pi projects to get you started,  now its time for you to create your own longer raspberry pi project.  The project can be anything you like, it could tie in with your interests or hobbies (a music mixing device, measure your running speed), it could be to help solve a problem , it could be just for fun (smart lights/room lighting at home). Try have a go at searching around your project idea, see if people have done it in the past or something similar to this? (this will be helpful for when you encounter errors or for having  a rough guide on what to do). 

## Example project idea

Creating a hand drawn digit recognition with the raspberry Pi. 

Equipment I will need: raspberryPi camera 

Cost: Â£4

Short description: 

Use the rasberrypi camera to take a picture of a number that I will draw, and for the number to be classfied by the rasberry pi of what it is. 

Why did I choose this project: 

Intrested in how recognition happens, snapchat on phones or facial recognition cameras work. Machine-leanring and AI are hot topics in the news at the moment and I wanted to understand more about this seeming phenomenon. 

What resources could I use?
