# Longer RaspberryPi Projects

## Now that you have had a go at writing some programmes, you'll now create and build your own Pi projects! 

What you build is up to you, you don't have to stick to the guides completly, if you have more ideas with what you can do with the equipment we have, go ahead! 
(also let us know if you would like to order anything else). 

### You will have 3 sessions to see how far you get with these projects. We are here to help you as much as we can during the sessions, but you are free to work on the projects outside of the lessons indpeendtly and with each other. 

We want to showcase your work and you will get to build on these projects futher at UCL.

The main aims of the projects are to have fun, develop independent learning skills and see what you can create. 

There are 3 projects: 

[Gamming_System]

[Sports_Science]

[Google_Voice_Kit]

Involes machine learning, asembeely and you will get to expand the project.
