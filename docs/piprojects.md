# Longer RaspberryPi Projects

## Now that you have had a go at writing some programmes, you'll now create and build your own Pi projects! 

What you build is up to you, you don't have to stick to the guides completly. If you have more ideas with what you can do with the equipment we have, go ahead! 

(Also let us know if you would like to order anything else). 

### You will have 3 sessions to see how far you get with these projects. We are here to help you as much as we can during the sessions, but you are free to work on the projects outside of the lessons indpendently and with each other. 

We want to showcase your work and you will get to build on these projects futher at UCL.

### The main aims of the projects are to have fun, develop independent learning skills and see what you can create. 

There are 3 projects, see their mini descriptions below and click on them to find the corresponding guides: 

If you find any more guides or useful resources, please let us know and we can add them to the pages.

[Sports Science](./pi_sports_science.md)

[Google Voice Kit](./pi_google_voice_kits.md) 

Involes machine learning, asembeely and you will get to expand the project.
