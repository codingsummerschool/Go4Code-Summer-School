# This project will look at the overlap between, sports, biology and technology.

### Read how Real Madrid players are using smart technology to improve their game, along with many of the richest football clubs: [Million megabit kits: how wearable tech is shaping the future of football](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/real-madrid-wearable-tech-shaping-football-future)

### Here is the youtube video instead of reading the entire article: [Million megabit kits: how wearable tech is shaping the future of football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFf_A0MeedU)

### Have a look at this article about The Embrace watch is an approved medical device and monitors subtle changes in sweat levels to detect when the wearer is having an epileptic seizure: [Medical-grade smartwatch is helping people live with epilepsy](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/empatica-embrace-epilepsy-wearable-medical-device)

Following themes from the articles above, the sports science raspberry Pi projects will look at trying to take ECG measurements from your heart and using the raspberry pi camera as a goal or basket ball scorer device. 

Remember that if you think of anything else, this is your project and you are free to change it. 

**1) ECG heart rate monitor, you have the following piece of kit:**

[ECG KIT](https://thepihut.com/products/gravity-analog-heart-rate-monitor-sensor-ecg-for-arduino) Look under the documents part of this link, and click the project WIKI. The project WIKI will help you with the inital set up. 

* Perhaps get it working first, which wil require some programming and reading documentation. 
* Then try to figure out what the ECG signal is actually used for in hospitals?

How does the ECG show heart defects or measurements? What is going on in the heart and body to produce the ECG? 

What data do you want to collect and study? 

2) You also have a raspberry Pi camera, 



3) We were thinking of also buying a GPS module: Would this be useful for you? If you could track your overall distance during a game, then you could work out your average speed during a game? 

4) How could we use the Raspberry Pi to measure sprint speed? What sensors do the Pi's have?
